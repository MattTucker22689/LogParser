*The conditions and requirements for this project to be completed successfully changed after the GUI solution was built. 

The final solution can be found in the "fin" folder. It achieves the same goal; however, it does so without the aid of a GUI

and the user inputs are hard coded.

The following repo is of a program I built during my flight test support engineer internship with QuickSilver Aerospace LLC.

The program aims to parse license usage data within time frames provided by users through a simple-to-use GUI.

I designed the GUI using QT Creator.

I packaged it using PyInstaller and Inno Setup for easy distribution throughout the office.

See requirements.txt for a list of other packages used.
