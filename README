The following repo is of a program I built during my flight test support engineer internship with QuickSilver Aerospace LLC.

The program aims to parse license usage data within time frames provided by users through a simple-to-use GUI.

The GUI was designed using QT Creator.

It was packaged using PyInstaller and Inno Setup for easy distribution throughout the office.

See requirements.txt for a list of other packages used.
